An addon that focuses on expanding the idea of Renegades.

These additions include:

More tutorial-esque ships that provide simple gameplay for some of the new features introduced by Vanilla Multiverse.

New sectors that serve as pseudo-resting points for travellers to patch themselves up and stock up on supplies and/or accept quests

Extra fanon lore that is well within MV's territory, not too outlandish but not too dull.
